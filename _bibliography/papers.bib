  abstract = {With a prevalence of 1:4000, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a leading cause for hereditary blindness. It is characterized by progressive photoreceptor death, leading to night  blindness in early stage, and gradual vision loss upon disease progression, heavily impacting the lives of those affected. Numerous gene loci where mutations can cause RP  have been identified so far. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a supportive tissue  with numerous functions vital for retinal health and visual function, like phagocytosis  of shed photoreceptor outer segments and provision of nutrients to the photoreceptors.  Dysregulations in the retina often negatively affect the RPE and vice versa. This close  interaction makes the RPE an interesting target when trying to understand the mechanism behind RP disease progression. Due to the many different mutations causing RP,  a mechanism independent approach to gene therapy is required to enable treatment of  significant proportions of patients.<br><br>In this work the Pde6b stop/stop mouse model for RP was used to analyze changes in  the RPEs ability to phagocytise shed photoreceptor outer segments, cell morphology  and metabolism at early (pw 8) and late (pw 30) disease stage. Phagocytosis was investigated by analyzing the internalization of labeled photoreceptor outer segments  by isolated RPE using fluorescence microscopy, while cell morphology was studied by  immunostaining of β-catenin in the cell membrane. Expression of RNA associated with  phagocytosis, morphology and metabolism was analyzed using qPCR.<br><br>Analysis of phagocytosis at pw 8 showed no significant difference in photoreceptor  outer segment internalization and expression of associated mRNA. Cell morphology  was also not affected at pw 8, but significantly deteriorated in pw 30, with increased  eccentricity, decreased solidity and loss of the typical hexagonal shape. In addition,  Micro RNA 204/211, responsible for maintaining epithelial form, were upregulated at  pw 30. Key genes for mitochondrial metabolism (Opa1) and glycolysis (Gapdh) were  shown to be upregulated at mRNA level in late stage.<br><br>This work provides useful insights into the changes occurring in the RPE during RP  progression, showing that while phagocytosis is not affected in early stage, RPE morphology deteriorates in late stage and is accompanied by metabolic adaptations.},
