Hi there! I am a master's student at LMU Munich, specializing in pharmaceutical sciences and interested in bioinformatics. I am motivated to advance scientific understanding of disease mechanisms while contributing to new therapeutic options.

For my [bachelor's thesis](/projects/bachelors-thesis/), I investigated the changes of the retinal pigment epithelium during retinitis pigmentosa disease progression. My technical skills include qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence microscopy, western blot and computer-aided image segmentation. I am always eager to learn new methods!

I am currently pursuing my master's degree to expand my expertise in molecular and computational methods. I plan to pursue a PhD to combine my wet lab experience with advanced computational methods.
