Hello! I am an MSc. student at LMU Munich, specializing in molecular pharmacology. I am motivated to advance scientific understanding while contributing to new therapeutic options. 

In my bachelor thesis, I investigated the changes of the retinal pigment epithelium during retinitis pigmentosa disease progression. My technical skills include qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence microscopy, western blot and computer-aided image segmentation.

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree to expand my expertise in molecular pharmacology and computational methods. I am planning to pursue a PhD to combine my wet lab expertise with advanced computational methods in the study of disease mechanisms.
