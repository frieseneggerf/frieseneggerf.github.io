Hi there! I am an M.Sc. student at LMU Munich, specializing in molecular pharmacology and interested in bioinformatics. I am motivated to advance scientific understanding of disease mechanisms while contributing to new therapeutic options. 

For my bachelor's thesis, I investigated the changes of the retinal pigment epithelium during retinitis pigmentosa disease progression. My technical skills include qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence microscopy, western blot and computer-aided image segmentation. I am always eager to learn new methods!

I am currently pursuing my master's degree to expand my expertise in molecular pharmacology and computational methods. I am planning to pursue a PhD to combine my wet lab expertise with advanced computational methods.
